                             Through it all, she still found the time to start her first 
                             tech start-up! The idea of building the Spark Now app  
                             came to her when she had a disagreement with her husband
                              about vacuuming! If asked, she will say she is the perfect
                               user for Spark Now. She loves helping couples reignite the
                                spark in their relationships. <br><br>

                            Dana currently lives with her husband Jay in 
                            Orlando Florida and they have two pets. 
                            
                            In her spare time, she enjoys going to the gym 
                            and spending time with her family.
