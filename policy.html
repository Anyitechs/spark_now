                    COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)<br><br>

                    When it comes to the collection of personal information 
                    from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's 
                    Online Privacy<br> Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. 
                    The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection 
                    agency, enforces the<br> COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators 
                    of websites and online services must do to protect children's 
                    privacy and safety online.<br><br>

                    We do not specifically market to children under the 
                    age of 13 years old.<br><br>

                    Fair Information Practices<br><br>

                    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the 
                    backbone of privacy law in the United States and the 
                    concepts they include have played a <br> significant role 
                    in the development of data protection laws around the 
                    globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice 
                    Principles and <br> how they should be implemented is 
                    critical to comply with the various privacy laws that 
                    protect personal information.<br><br>

                    In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices 
                    we will take the following responsive action, should a 
                    data breach occur:<br>
                    We will notify you via email<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ Within 1 business day

                    We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle 
                    which requires that individuals have the right to 
                    legally pursue enforceable rights against <br> data 
                    collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. 
                    This principle requires not only that individuals have 
                    enforceable rights against<br> data users, but also that 
                    individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies 
                    to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by<br> data 
                    processors.<br><br>

                    CAN SPAM Act<br><br>

                    The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for 
                    commercial email, establishes requirements for 
                    commercial messages, gives recipients the<br> right 
                    to have emails stopped from being sent to them, 
                    and spells out tough penalties for violations.<br><br>

                    We collect your email address in order to:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Send information, respond to inquiries, 
                    and/or other requests or questions<br><br>

                    To be in accordance withCANSPAM, we agree to the following:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Not use false or misleading subjects or email 
                    addresses.<br><br>
